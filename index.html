    <p1>I've got your name on my skin<br>And your taste on my lips<br>And the loving memory of your beautiful scent<br>
        I've got your voice on my mind<br>And your heart with mine<br>
        And this perfect feeling of sharing our lives<br><br>
        There's not a place that I can go<br>Where I don't feel your ghost<br>
        There won't ever be a time<br>That I wanna be without you<br><br>
        What I wouldn't give to see that smile<br>Hold you close just for a while<br>
        Courtney Rae please grace this mess<br>
        And light my life up with your style<br>What I wouldn't give to see those eyes<br>Just a million more times<br>
        Courtney Rae please grace this mess<br>
        And light my world up, be my wife
